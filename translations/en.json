Your agents can access this page by clicking the Iframe app icon.\n\nThe Iframe app supports websites that include the [Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK](https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_app_framework_sdk). Check out [Iframes in Apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/agent/iframes_in_apps) to learn more.\n\nSee this [Iframe app article](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660696) for more information on how to setup the app.\n\nFor questions, please email [support@zendesk.com](mailto:support@zendesk.com).\n\nBy enabling this app, You agree to the [Built by Zendesk Terms of Use](https://www.zendesk.com/company/built-by-zendesk-agmt/)."
