The Zendesk Iframe app lets your agents quickly navigate to an external website and then return to their tickets without interrupting their workflow. Your agents can look up any external site and reference information such as order details or data on another system.\n\nThe Iframe app presents the external source as an iframe in your Zendesk Support instance. Your agents can access this page by clicking the Iframe app icon.\n\nThe Iframe app supports websites that include the [Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK](https://github.com/zendesk/zendesk_app_framework_sdk). Check out [Iframes in Apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/agent/iframes_in_apps) to learn more.\n\nSee this [Iframe app article](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203660696) for more information on how to setup the app.\n\nFor questions, please email [support@zendesk.com](mailto:support@zendesk.com).\n\nBy enabling this app, You agree to the [Built by Zendesk Terms of Use](https://www.zendesk.com/company/built-by-zendesk-agmt/).",
