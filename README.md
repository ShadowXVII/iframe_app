Iframe App
=========================

This is the Iframe app for the Agent interface, formerly known as Sidebar Icon app.

It was designed to allow Zendesk agents to quickly flip to a web site and then flip back to their tickets without interrupting your workflow. This can be especially useful if you use a page to look up things like orders or other data from another system. The Iframe app displays an external source into a separate page in new Zendesk that can be accessed through a button on the left hand navigation bar. Check out an article that details the functionality in our forums [here](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/22051533-Sidebar-and-Text-apps-for-the-new-Zendesk).

The Iframe app supports websites that include the Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK. Check out [Iframes in Apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/agent/iframes_in_apps) to learn more.
