Sidebar Icon App
=========================

This is the Sidebar Icon app for New Zendesk.

It was designed to allow Zendesk agents to quickly flip to a web site and then flip back to their tickets without interrupting your workflow. This can be especially useful if you use a page to look up things like orders or other data from another system. The Sidebar Icon app iFrames in an external source into a separate page in new Zendesk that can be accessed through a button on the left hand navigation bar. Check out an article that details the functionality in our forums [here](https://support.zendesk.com/entries/22051533-Sidebar-and-Text-apps-for-the-new-Zendesk).

The Sidebar Icon app is available to all Zendesk accounts via the app listing. Please submit bug reports to [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/requests/new). Pull requests are welcome.
