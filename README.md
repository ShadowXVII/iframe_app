Iframe Ticket Sidebar App
=========================

This is the Iframe Ticket Sidebar app for Zendesk, based on the Iframe App by Zendesk.

It was designed to allow Zendesk agents to quickly flip to a web site and then flip back to their tickets without interrupting their workflow. This can be especially useful if you use a page to look up things like orders or other data from another system. The Iframe app displays an external source in a viewport on the ticket sidebar.

The Iframe Ticket Sidebar app supports websites that include the Zendesk App Framework (ZAF) SDK. Check out [Iframes in Apps](https://developer.zendesk.com/apps/docs/agent/iframes_in_apps) to learn more.
